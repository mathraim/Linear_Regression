# Linear_Regression
Implemented linear regression from scratch on matlab(octave)

In this exercise, I implemented linear regression from scratch on matlab(octave) and get to see it work on data.  

Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. 
The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
You would like to use this linear regression to help you select which city to expand to next

- The first part of **ex1.m** is just a practice with Octave/MATLAB syntax.
- The file **ex1data1.txt** contains the dataset for our linear regression problem.
  - The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. 
  - A negative value for profit indicates a loss.
- **plotData.m** contains a function that creates a scatter plot of the data.
- **computeCost.m** contains a function that computes J(Î¸) which is thhe cost function for the model
- **gradientDescent.m** contains a function that performs a Gradient Decent 
- **ex1.m** loads the dataset and combines all the function above to perform a linear regression
